# Heart-Disease
Heart Disease Prediction  This project presents a comprehensive Machine Learning solution for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical information. Its purpose is to provide a reliable, data-driven approach for early detection, which can assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential risks.
The workflow begins with data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing features to ensure high-quality input for the models. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover relationships among key medical attributes, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors, which contribute to heart disease risk.

A variety of supervised learning models are implemented, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, enabling comparison to achieve optimal predictive performance. Models are evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, ensuring robust and interpretable results.

A notable feature of this project is an interactive prediction interface, allowing users to input their own health data and receive immediate risk assessment. The system is designed with proper error handling, user-friendly output, and clear explanations of predictions.

The project is developed in Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The codebase is modular, well-structured, and thoroughly documented, making it suitable for learning, extension, or integration into larger healthcare analytics applications.

This repository demonstrates the practical application of Machine Learning in the medical domain, combining predictive modeling with interpretability, usability, and scalability. It serves as a valuable reference for developers, data scientists, and researchers interested in healthcare analytics and predictive modeling.
